# ACWW-Research
Here you can find my (and probably from other contributors as well) research work of AC:WW.

- For Structures and actual researches, look inside the `research` directory.

NOTE: I will continue with my research on the [wiki](https://github.com/SuperSaiyajinStackZ/ACWW_Research/wiki).

You can find a few tools i did for AC:WW inside the `tools` directory. Right now it includes a Checksum Updater.
